Implemented code in ModelLinkage file only, under TODO1 and TODO2. Wasn't able to get most of the motion code to work, so I commented TODO2 out. Will present my sample code for TODO3 and progress I made on that during my lab demo because I had to remove it from my code due to crashing. Creatures are meant to be 2 ants and a (strange looking) anteater. Tried to make legs rotate to make a crawling motion for the ants in animationUpdate().
